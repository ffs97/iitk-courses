Please compile the programs as follows.

gcc -O3 server.c -o server
gcc -O3 client.c -o client
gcc -O3 fork_msg.c -o fork_msg
gcc -O3 chat.c -o chat
gcc -O3 fork_shm.c -o fork_shm
gcc -O3 fork_shm_ftok.c -o fork_shm_ftok
gcc -O3 -pthread pthread.c -o pthread
gcc -O3 clone_shm.c -o clone_shm
gcc -O3 clone_shm_thread_1.c -o clone_shm_thread_1
gcc -O3 clone_shm_thread_2.c -o clone_shm_thread_2
gcc -O3 server_signal.c -o server_signal
gcc -O3 signal.c -o signal
gcc -O3 sigchld.c -o sigchld
gcc -O3 setjmp_longjmp.c -o setjmp_longjmp

In the server/client example (server.c, client.c), launch the server first. Launch the 
client on a different terminal (but on the same machine) so that you can see the progress 
of both. You can launch multiple concurrent clients on different terminals as well. They 
will all connect to the same server and communicate with it.

The chat program takes the username of the chat partner as a command line argument. For a chat
session to work correctly, two users must invoke the chat program on the same machine.

Observe that clone_shm creates two processes with different PIDs. On the other hand,
clone_shm_thread_1, clone_shm_thread_2, and pthread create threads that share the PID with the creator. This
PID is known as the thread group id. Within each thread group, each thread gets a system-wide
unique thread id. In such a situation, the wait() call has no meaning and therefore, you need
other solutions to make the parent wait for the children to finish up. Also, you need to prevent
the children from terminating until the parent is done. Two possible solutions are shown in
clone_shm_thread_1 and clone_shm_thread_2.

In the server_signal example, launch the server_signal process first. Launch the client (client.c) on a different
terminal so that you can see the progress of both. This is the same client program used earlier.

Run the signal example (signal.c) and remember to explicitly kill the odd-numbered child processes by invoking
the "kill -9 pid" command (without quotes and pid replaced by the pid of the process to be killed)
from the shell command prompt. Otherwise these processes will keep running for ever.

Run the sigchld example (sigchld.c) once with no command line argument and once with some command line argument.
Without any command line argument, the parent process should terminate as soon as one child exits.
With a command line argument, the parent process will wait for all children to exit.
In either case, please kill the non-terminating children by invoking the "kill -9 pid" command (without quotes
and pid replaced by the pid of the process to be killed) from the shell command prompt. Otherwise these 
processes will keep running for ever.

To examine the context after a setjmp() call, you could use the GNU debugger (gdb) to attach a
breakpoint right after the setjmp() and print the variable of type jmp_buf that was passed as
the argument of setjmp(). Use "print /x" without the quotes to print in hex. To see the disassembly 
of the executable, use "objdump -D executablename" without the quotes from the shell prompt.
This may be needed to see what the program counter (known as the instruction pointer or IP in x86)
contains in the saved context.
